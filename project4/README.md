## 📖 Introduction

This markdown summarizes my learnings in **data modeling**, primarily focused around **MongoDB** using **Mongoose** with **Node.js** and **Express**. I explored real-world model creation for systems like **eCommerce**, **ToDo Managers**, and **Hospital Management Systems**.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

### 📊 Data Modeling Basics

- Data modeling is about **structuring and organizing your database schema** to reflect real-world entities.
- It involves understanding how **various data fields relate to each other**, and optimizing for both **read** and **write** operations.

### 🛠️ Tools Explored

| Tool                                           | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Moon Modeler**                               | ER Diagram & Data Modeling tool for MongoDB/SQL (used in corporates) |
| **Mongoose**                                   | ODM library to define schemas and models in MongoDB for Node.js      |
| **GitHub Codespaces, StackBlitz, CodeSandbox** | Cloud-based development environments                                 |

### 📦 Modeling Use Cases

1. **🛒 E-commerce System**

   - Models: `User`, `Product`, `Cart`, `Order`, `Review`
   - Relationships:

     - User ↔ Orders
     - Product ↔ Reviews
     - Cart ↔ Products

2. **✅ ToDo Manager**

   - Models: `User`, `Todo`, `Category`, `Priority`
   - Each Todo is user-specific and optionally categorized with deadlines

3. **🏥 Hospital Management System**

   - Models: `Doctor`, `Patient`, `Appointment`, `Prescription`, `Department`
   - Complex relations and dependencies:

     - Appointment: link between doctor, patient, and schedule
     - Prescription: linked to both doctor and patient with multiple medicines

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Best Practices in Data Modeling

- **Think relationally**, even in NoSQL: Use references or embedded documents as appropriate.
- Use **clear naming conventions** and **field constraints** via Mongoose schemas.
- **Normalize** data where necessary; **denormalize** for performance when it makes sense.
- Document each model using **JSDoc or TypeScript interfaces**.
- Design with **future extensibility** in mind: leave room for new fields or relations.
- Focus on **read/write pattern optimization** (frequent queries should be fast).

## 🖼️ Handling Images in Applications

> Images are large and can impact performance. Here’s how they can be handled smartly:

1. **📦 Buffer in DB**

   - Stored directly in MongoDB using `Buffer`
   - **Drawback**: Increases DB size, slower queries

2. **📁 Server Folder**

   - Store images in a static `public` folder
   - DB stores the **public URL path**

3. **☁️ Cloud Storage (Recommended)**

   - Services like **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**
   - Store image in cloud, DB stores the **external URL**

---

## 🧩 Designing for Professional Domains

- Systems like **Hospital Management**, **Inventory Systems**, **School CRMs** require **domain-specific modeling**.
- It's important to:

  - Study the **domain requirements** first
  - Map out real-world entities, their attributes, and relationships
  - Create **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)** using tools like **Moon Modeler**
  - Apply **access control logic** and **data validation rules**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Learning data modeling is not just about defining models — it's about understanding **real-world systems**, mapping them efficiently in a database, and thinking critically about **how data flows and grows**. Tools like **Mongoose**, paired with visual ER modeling via **Moon Modeler**, make it powerful and manageable.
